# Utterd — Project Spec

**Last updated**: 2026-03-26

## What This Project Does

Utterd is a macOS menu bar daemon that automatically triages voice memos into Reminders, Calendar, and Notes. It monitors the iCloud Voice Memos sync directory, extracts embedded transcripts, classifies them via a language model (on-device or remote), and creates items in the destination apps — no manual intervention after setup. Built for a single productivity-minded user who wants voice capture as a reliable front door to their trusted systems.

## Project Goals

- Ship a working end-to-end pipeline: voice memo file appears on disk → correct item shows up in Reminders, Calendar, or Notes within 5 minutes, zero manual steps
- Every memo processed exactly once — no duplicates, no misses, even across restarts and duplicate file events
- Privacy by default: on-device LLM (macOS 26+) as the primary provider; remote endpoint only as a configured fallback
- Eventually open-source the project — codebase must be clean, self-documenting, and easy for outside contributors to build and run

---

## Quality Goals

| Priority | Goal | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Reliability | A missed or duplicated memo erodes trust in the entire system — the user must never wonder "did that memo make it?" |
| 2 | Privacy | Voice memos contain personal content; on-device processing is the default. Remote use requires informed consent |
| 3 | Maintainability | Single developer, eventual open-source — code must be easy to understand and modify without tribal knowledge |
| 4 | Operability | Every failure must be visible (menu bar alerts + persistent log) so the user knows when the system needs attention |

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: End-to-end processing of a single memo completes in under 60 seconds, excluding network latency for remote LLM calls and iCloud sync time
- **Privacy**: On-device LLM → no memo content leaves the machine. Remote LLM → user is explicitly informed that transcript text will be sent to the configured server
- **Security**: Remote endpoint credentials stored in system Keychain only — never in plaintext config. App must be hardened against LLM prompt injection
- **Persistence**: Deduplication store and failure log survive app restarts. Entries older than 90 days may be pruned automatically
- **Failure thresholds**: Each memo attempted once. No automatic retry. 10+ consecutive failures → error state in status indicator
- **Reliability**: App must run indefinitely without memory leaks or resource exhaustion. Must survive directory changes, LLM unavailability, and API failures without crashing

## Architecture Summary

```
iCloud Sync ──▶ [File Watcher] ──▶ [Pipeline] ──▶ Reminders (EventKit)
  (.m4a files)        │                               Calendar  (EventKit)
                      │                               Notes     (Scripting Bridge)
                      ▼
                 [LLM Provider]
                  ├─ On-device (Foundation Model, macOS 26+)
                  └─ Remote (OpenAI-compatible, HTTPS)
```

**Key design patterns:**
- Sequential pipes-and-filters pipeline — detection → copy → extraction → classification → data extraction → routing → creation → dedup → cleanup. Each stage is an isolated function with typed inputs/outputs
- Protocol-based LLM provider abstraction — a Swift protocol defines the LLM interface; concrete types implement on-device and remote variants
- Exactly-once processing via persistent dedup store — checked before processing, written after successful creation

**Data flow:**
A new .m4a file arrives in the watched directory → copied to a temp location → embedded transcript extracted from the copy → transcript sent to LLM for classification + structured data extraction → routing rules applied → item created in destination app via system API → file identity recorded in dedup store → temp copy cleaned up.

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------|------|------------------------|
| XcodeGen over committed .xcodeproj | Project will be open-sourced — keeps project definition human-readable, diffable, and merge-conflict-free | 2026-03-24 | Committing .xcodeproj — rejected for poor OSS contributor experience |
| Local SPM package (`Libraries/`) for core logic | Encapsulation — isolates core logic from the app target, enables fast `swift test` without Xcode | 2026-03-24 | Everything in app target — rejected for lack of modularity |
| Swift 6.2 strict concurrency (`complete`) | Eliminates data races at compile time; required for Foundation Model framework | 2026-03-24 | Relaxed concurrency — rejected, doesn't catch bugs early enough |
| SwiftUI MenuBarExtra over AppKit NSStatusItem | Native SwiftUI integration, less boilerplate, aligns with @Observable pattern | 2026-03-24 | AppKit NSStatusItem — rejected unless SwiftUI proves insufficient |
| @Observable over ObservableObject | Per-property view invalidation, less boilerplate, modern Swift pattern | 2026-03-24 | ObservableObject + @Published — legacy pattern |
| Scripting Bridge for Notes | Only known mechanism for programmatic Notes access with folder targeting | 2026-03-24 | No alternative available |
| Keychain for remote LLM credentials | macOS security standard — avoids plaintext secrets in config files | 2026-03-24 | Plaintext in YAML config — rejected for security |

## Code Conventions

**Patterns to follow:**
```swift
// Models: @Observable + @MainActor + final class
@Observable
@MainActor
final class SomeModel {
    var items: [String] = []
}
```

```swift
// Tests: Swift Testing with @Suite and @Test
@Suite("SomeModel")
struct SomeModelTests {
    @Test("descriptive test name")
    @MainActor
    func someTest() {
        // Arrange → Act → Assert using #expect
    }
}
```

```swift
// State sharing: @State at the owner, @Environment for children
@State private var appState = AppState()
// ...
.environment(appState)
```

**Patterns to avoid:**
```swift
// Do NOT use ObservableObject/@Published — use @Observable instead
class BadModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var items: [String] = []  // ← legacy pattern
}
```

---

## Testing Strategy

**Framework:** Swift Testing (`@Test`, `#expect`, `@Suite`)
**Location:** `UtterdTests/` for app-level tests, `Libraries/Tests/CoreTests/` for library tests
**Naming:** Test structs named `[Subject]Tests`, test functions describe the behavior being verified

**Test types:**
- **Unit tests (app)**: `xcodebuild -scheme Utterd -destination 'platform=macOS' test`
- **Unit tests (library)**: `cd Libraries && swift test` — fast, no Xcode required

**Testing conventions:**
- Use Swift Testing exclusively for new tests — XCTest only for legacy code that hasn't been migrated
- `@MainActor` on test functions that touch `@MainActor`-isolated types
- Arrange → Act → Assert structure; use `#expect` for assertions

---

## Git Workflow

**Branch naming:** `feat/description`, `fix/description`, `docs/description`, `chore/description`
**Commit format:** Conventional commits — `feat: `, `fix: `, `docs: `, `chore: `, `test: `
**PR process:** Build + test must pass before merge: `xcodebuild -scheme Utterd -destination 'platform=macOS' build test`

## Integration Points

| Service | Purpose | Auth | Docs |
|---------|---------|------|------|
| iCloud Voice Memos sync directory | Source of .m4a voice memo files | Disk access permission | `~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.VoiceMemos.shared/Recordings` |
| macOS Foundation Model (macOS 26+) | On-device LLM for classification/extraction | None (on-device) | Apple platform docs |
| Remote LLM (OpenAI-compatible) | Fallback LLM provider | API key in Keychain | User-configured endpoint URL |
| EventKit | Reminders and Calendar item creation | System permission prompt | Apple EventKit docs |
| Scripting Bridge | Notes item creation with folder targeting | Automation permission | Apple Scripting Bridge docs |
| System Keychain | Secure credential storage for remote LLM | Keychain Services API | Apple Security framework docs |
| FSEvents (CoreServices) | File system monitoring for new voice memos | Disk access permission | Apple FSEvents docs |

## Boundaries & Constraints

### Always Do
- Run `xcodegen generate` after modifying `project.yml` before building
- Run build + test before creating a PR
- Use Swift Testing (`@Test`, `#expect`) for all new tests
- Use `@Observable` pattern for new models — never `ObservableObject`
- Read from temporary copies of voice memo files, never the originals
- Check the dedup store before processing and update it after successful creation

### Ask First
- Before adding third-party dependencies (the project minimizes external deps for OSS simplicity)
- Before changing the pipeline stage order or adding/removing stages
- Before modifying `project.yml` target structure or build settings
- Before dropping to AppKit (NSViewRepresentable) — SwiftUI first
- Before changing the LLM provider protocol interface

### Never Do
- Never modify or delete original voice memo files in the sync directory
- Never store credentials in plaintext configuration files
- Never skip the dedup store check — processing without dedup creates duplicates
- Never process memos if the dedup store cannot be written (prevents duplicates on disk-full)
- Never send telemetry or analytics data off the machine

## Known Gotchas

- **Voice memo transcript format is undocumented**: The embedded transcript location/format within .m4a files is not publicly documented by Apple — needs investigation before implementing extraction
- **Foundation Model availability for unsandboxed apps**: The app runs outside the App Store sandbox. Whether macOS Foundation Model framework works for unsandboxed apps is unconfirmed
- **Notes scripting bridge limitations**: Programmatic Notes access via Scripting Bridge is less well-documented than EventKit. Folder targeting and content formatting support need investigation
- **App is partially implemented**: The voice memo file watcher (detection stage) is functional in `Libraries/Sources/Core/`. Remaining pipeline stages (transcript extraction, classification, routing, creation) and the menu bar UI (`MenuBarExtra`) have not been implemented
- **macOS 15 vs macOS 26 split**: On-device LLM requires macOS 26+. On macOS 15–25, the app requires a configured remote endpoint and must surface an alert if no provider is available
